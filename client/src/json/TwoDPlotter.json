    "aboutTheProject":"2D plotter is my recent project which downgrades my very old 3D printer to 2D plotter. In order to do so, I had to rebuilt hardware of the machine (designing my own components included) and do couple of changes to firmware which is easily configurable. This project made me realize how much I love connection between programming and mechanical designing !",
